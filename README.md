# Sportsball Pickr

Organize contests and play with your friends. Create a public pool that anyone can join, or a private one that only a select few join.

Currently choose between the following sports:

* Football

  * NFl

Configure your pool to pick games against the spread and/or the over/under and include the post-season and/or bowls.
